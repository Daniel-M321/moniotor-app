# Moniotor-back

## This is the backend logic for my Moniotor Webapp. This will implement **routes** (endpoints) for my Vue frontend to call and request sensor data stored on the influxDB instance.

## - **Note to DAN**: If you're having issues with undefined, you've probably forgot about async functions again.
