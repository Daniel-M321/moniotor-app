# Moniotor-back

This is the backend logic for my Moniotor Webapp. This will implement Express **routes** (middleware endpoints) for my Vue frontend to call and request sensor data stored on the influxDB instance. Alongside the data, analysis on the data is also returned.

## Notes
Main file is found in the index.mjs. Tests can be found in the src folder. JSON objects for the analysis is also found in the src/assets folder.
